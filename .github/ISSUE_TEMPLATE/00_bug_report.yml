        ## A note from the maintainers

        Thank you very much for taking the time to submit a bug report! Community reports to this repository are one of our primary means of feedback, so we greatly appreciate you taking the time to do so. With that in mind, we ask for a few considerations to help keep things running smoothly.

        ## Before submitting a bug report

        #### Terraform Core related issues

        Consider whether your issue may be related to Terraform Core, rather than the AWS Cloud Control Provider. In those cases, please [open an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/new/choose) in the Terraform Core repository instead. Some common examples of this include:

          - Issues with the [HashiCorp Configuration Language](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html)
          - Resource creation/deletion ordering issues
          - Issues related to Terraform's [state file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) or [state dackend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration) issues (including the S3 backend)
          - [Provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax) or [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
          - Issues that span across multiple providers

        #### Search for similar reports

        Please [search the existing issues](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-awscc/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if someone else has already reported the bug you experienced. This helps to, where appropriate, keep all relevant information in one place (including any potential workarounds).

        > [!TIP]
        > Searching for keywords such as error messages, resources names, or argument names is often helpful in finding related issues.
        >
        > Including closed issues in your search can help locate past solutions from the community or point towards regressions.
